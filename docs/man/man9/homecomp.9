.SH NAME

homecomp \- homing module template
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
Custom Homing module loaded with \fB[EMCMOT]HOMEMOD=homecomp\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION


Example of a homing module buildable with halcompile.
Demonstrates required code for #includes, function definitions, etc.

An  actual homing scheme is \fBnot\fR implemented but all necessary
functions are included as skeleton code.   (All joints are
effectively homed at all times and cannot be unhomed).

See the source code file: src/emc/motion/homing.c for the baseline
implementation that includes all functions for the default \fBhomemod\fR
module.

To avoid updates that overwrite homecomp.comp, best practice is
to rename the file and its component name (example:
\fBuser_homecomp.comp, user_homecomp\fR).

The (renamed) component can be built and installed with
halcompile and then substituted for the default homing module
(\fBhomemod\fR) using:

  $ linuxcnc \fB-m user_homecomp\fR someconfig.ini

or by inifile setting: \fB[EMCMOT]HOMEMOD=user_homecomp\fR

\fBNote:\fRIf using a deb install:

1) halcompile is provided by the package linuxcnc-dev

2) This source file for BRANCHNAME (master,2.9,etc) is downloadable from github:
