<p>Set the probe above the desired edge 2-4 mm (the approximate position shows the colored dot on the button). Fill in the parameters. Press only! corresponding to this position button.</p>

<p>Then there will be two measurements, as indicated by the arrows on the button.</p>
The parameters are set so:
<p><b>edge length</b> = distance between measured points</p>
<p><b>xy clearance</b> = offset from the edge</p>
<p><b>z clearance</b> = embedment</p>
<b>Auto Rot</b>:
<p>-if Yes, then after measuring the coordinate system will automatically rotates by the measured angle,</p>
<p>-if No, then the angle is simply measured and written out.</p>
<p>The angle is calculated relative to the X axis for the front and back faces, relative to the Y axis for the right and left faces.</p>
<p>After the coordinate system has been rotated, all other measurement groups will start working in a new coordinate system.
You can also rotate the coordinate system at an arbitrary angle manually - type an angle in the New angle field and click the button to approve.</p>
