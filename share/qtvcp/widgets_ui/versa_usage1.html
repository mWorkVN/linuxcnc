<H3>Basic Process</H3>
<p>Install the probe into the spindle.</p>
<p>Manually jog the probe tip to about 2-10 mm above the workpiece surface.</p>
<p>Manually jog the XY position to about the position indicated by the colored dot on the appropriate button of the Probe Screen.</p>
<p>Fill in the probing parameters. When you change any of the parameters, they are automatically saved in the PREFERENCES file specified in the INI file.</p>

<p>Hit <b>only</b> the button that corresponds to the position of the probe above the workpiece.</p>

<p>All the probe routines end with XY moving to the probed point (or edge, or corner, or center). The Z height is restored to the original starting position.</p>
