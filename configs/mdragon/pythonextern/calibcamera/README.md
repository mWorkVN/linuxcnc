## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Make sure python 3.x is installed on your PC. To check if and which version is installed, run the following command:
```
python -V
```
If this results an error, this means that python isn’t installed on your PC! please install it from [the original website](https://www.python.org/)

3. (optional) it is recommended that you create a python virtual environment and install the necessary libraries in it to prevent versions collisions:
```
python -m venv CV
```
where CV is the environment name. Once you’ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.
```
CV\Scripts\activate.bat
```

4. Install required libraries from the provided file (**requirements.txt**):

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you provide the correct path of **requirements.txt**

5. DONE :) Run the script:

```
python3 calibration_GUI.py
```
